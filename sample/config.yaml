# This variable defined the network required for each role.
# Acourding the list create the port named with `servername-network-port`
#
# Avaliable value for this variable:
#   role: controller, compute, network
#   network: internal, external, storage, compute, octavia, tunnel
#
# Format:
# ---
# role_used_network:
#   role: [ network, network, network ]
#
# Example:
# Controller with 1 node c1, compute with 1 node com1.
# Controller with internal, external networks. Compute with internal, network.
# ---
# role_used_network:
#   controller: [ internal, external, storage ]
#   compute: [ internal, tunnel, storage ]
#
# Then create port:
#   - c1-internal-port
#   - c1-external-port
#   - com1-internal-port
#
